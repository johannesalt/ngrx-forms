- change the reducer created by `createFormGroupReducerWithUpdate` to only apply the provided update function objects if the state changed as a result of applying the action to the form state (this is only relevant in cases where the update function is closing over variables that may change without the form state changing in which case you can simply manually call the `formGroupReducer` and the `updateGroup` function); this provides a performance improvement for large form states and their update function objects ([b1f49cd](https://github.com/johannesalt/ngrx-forms/commit/b1f49cd))

- replace `createFormGroupReducerWithUpdate` with `createFormStateReducerWithUpdate` ([1b6114c](https://github.com/johannesalt/ngrx-forms/commit/1b6114c))
- change form arrays and groups to preserve the values of `isDirty`, `isEnabled`, `isTouched`, and `isSubmitted` when the state is changed instead of always recomputing the values of these properties based on the state's child states + mark arrays and groups as dirty when adding or removing controls ([9202d1e](https://github.com/johannesalt/ngrx-forms/commit/9202d1e))
- add support for non-primitive control values through boxing ([90728c5](https://github.com/johannesalt/ngrx-forms/commit/90728c5))

- add support for local form states outside of the ngrx store ([#166](https://github.com/johannesalt/ngrx-forms/pull/166), [#165](https://github.com/johannesalt/ngrx-forms/issues/165))
- add NGRX_UPDATE_ON_TYPE type to library exports ([ce91c8e](https://github.com/johannesalt/ngrx-forms/commit/ce91c8e))
- allow `onNgrxForms` to work on form states directly instead of requiring form states to be direct children of reduced states ([b81abb4](https://github.com/johannesalt/ngrx-forms/commit/b81abb4))

- changed form control state directive to run its initialization code inside the `ngAfterViewInit` hook instead of `ngOnInit` to allow proper interaction with form elements that can have dynamically rendered children they depend on (e.g. dynamic `option`s for `select`s) ([b60fe40](https://github.com/johannesalt/ngrx-forms/commit/b60fe40))
